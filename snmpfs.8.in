.TH SNMPFS 8 "SNMP fuse file system" "22 December 2016" "snmpfs manual"

.SH NAME
snmpfs \- fuse file system for SNMP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpfs
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI snmpfs
is a fuse file system for SNMPv3 agents, loosely based on the likenamed plan9 file system interface.  When started, it allows access to the MIB of configured SNMP agents through a file system subtree.  A basic interface is provided for listening on incoming SNMP traps as well.  MIB objects can either be queried by directly specifying their OID, or by their translated pathname.  The latter requires the necessary MIB definition files.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c\fR <config-file>
Use configuration file at the specified location instead of the default file.
.TP
.B \-d
Enable debug logging.
.TP
.B \-f
Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not daemonize).
.TP
.B \-v
This prints the name and version of the application.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file consists of a daemon config section and one or more agent definitions.

.IP "\fIDaemon configuration\fR" 4
.IX Item "Daemon configuration"

.nf
daemon:
{
  uid = "snmp-usr";
  gid = "snmp-grp";
  trap-port = 162;
  engine-id = "0xAABBCCDDEEFF";
  mount-dir = "/net/snmp";
  cache-dir = "/var/lib/snmp";
  mib-dir = "/share/snmp/mibs";
};
.fi

The daemon drops its privileges to the configured \fBuid\fR and \fBgid\fR after initialization.  The \fBtrap-port\fR contains the port on which the daemon listens for incoming agent notifications.  The \fBengine-id\fR specifies the USM security engine ID used for acknowledged notifications ('informs').  The \fBmount-dir\fR holds the directory on which the file system is mounted.  The \fBcache-dir\fR contains the path in which the runtime configuration is cached.  The \fBmib-dir\fR contains the path to the MIB definition files.

agents = (
  {
    alias = "example";
    address = "fe80::123";
    port = 161;
    version = 3;
    context-engine-id = "0xAABBCCDDEEFF";
    context-name = "test";
    retries = 3;
    timeout = 2;
    security:
    {
      model = "USM";
      level = "authPriv";
      name = "private";
      engine-id = "0xAABBCCDDEEFF";
      auth-algo = "SHA1";
      priv-algo = "AES128";
      auth-password = "hunter2";
      priv-password = "hunter2";
      auth-key = "0x00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF";
      priv-key = "0x00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF";
    };
  }
);
.fi

.PP
The agent section contains one or more SNMP agent descriptors.  The \fBalias\fR specifies the directory name under which the agent is mapped;  if left empty, the \fBaddress\fR is used.  Only \fBversion\fR 3 is supported for now.  The \fBcontext engine ID\fR and \fBname\fR will be discovered if left empty.  The \fBtimeout\fR is specified in seconds.

.PP
The security configuration can take the following values:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmodel\fR: only user-based security (USM) supported
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBlevel\fR: one of the following: 'noAuthNoPriv', 'authNoPriv', 'authPriv'
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBname\fR: the security name used during communication
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBengine-id\fR: security engine ID of the agent; if left empty, it will be discovered during the first request
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBauth-algo\fR: one of the following: 'SHA1', 'SHA2-224', 'SHA2-256', 'SHA2-384', 'SHA2-512'
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBpriv-algo\fR: one of the following: 'AES128', 'AES192', 'AES256'
.IP "\(bu" 4
for both authentication and privacy, either a password or a pre-shared key is required.  The passwords are specified in the \fBauth-password\fR and \fBpriv-password\fR fields and will be diversified with the engine ID of the agent to derive the localized keys.  The pre-shared keys are specified in the \fBauth-key\fR and \fBpriv-key\fR fields;  these are assumed localized already.

.PP
The configuration file can be reloaded by issueing a SIGHUP to the process.
